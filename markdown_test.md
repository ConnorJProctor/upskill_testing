# My Markdown Test

## Explanation
Learning **Markdown** has been on my to-do list for _quite some time_ now.  It always seemed like the method smart people used to keep documentation.  However, I never seemed to find the time to learn it until now.

### Why the delay?
Often, when I am writing something, I need to write it quickly and get it in someone else's hands.  As with most tasks, I will default to the tools that I am comfortable with.  In my case, this is typically full-featured word processing tools, such as Word or OneNote.  
However, a podcaster that I listen to, Paul Thurrott, repeatedly mentioned using Markdown-based tools for his show notes and, if I'm not mistaken, his books. Additionally, I read a book called _The Pragmatic Programmer_, which stated

> We personally prefer using a markup system such as Markdown: when writing, we focus only on the content, and leave the presentation to whatever tool we use to render it.

### What did I use to learn this?
I found a nifty little site called [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), which gently walks you through the different formatting options.  This document will be posted to my [upskill_testing repository](https://github.com/ConnorJProctor/upskill_testing) and may later be shared on [my website][my website].

### What are the benefits of using Markdown?
* I can focus on what I'm writing and worry about its presentation later.
* I can avoid using a large unwieldy word processor.
  * I don't want to name names, so let's make something up...like Microsoft Word.
* My writing becomes portable and can be rendered by many different tools.
* Anything I compose is immediately compatible with all major version control providers, such as GitHub or DevOps
* I can join the elitist class of people that know how to write in Markdown.
